# Advanced Object Detection for Real-Time Risk Analysis in Automotive Safety

**A Dynamic Safety Monitoring System Using YOLOv2**

---

## 🚗 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on enhancing automotive safety through real-time object detection and dynamic risk assessment. Using the YOLOv2 model, the system processes dashcam footage to identify objects in the vehicle’s path and dynamically evaluates their risk based on size, proximity, and location. This innovative approach addresses the critical need for adaptive and proactive risk management in modern vehicles.

## ✨ **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detects objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists using the YOLOv2 model.
- **Dynamic Risk Thresholding**: Implements scalable risk thresholds based on object density and position.
- **Zone-Based Risk Analysis**: Classifies risks into critical zones (center, left, right) for precise monitoring.
- **Proactive Alerts**: Generates visual and audible alerts for high-risk objects.
- **High Performance**: Operates at 30 FPS with low latency on standard GPU hardware.
